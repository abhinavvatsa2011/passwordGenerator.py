# passwordGenerator.py
A python code that can be an extension for many other software to suggest users a password that is unique and very hard to crack. 
This code is a revisit of the project I submitted for my class XIIth practical examination 2020. 
Basically what I did was that I linked the password generator function mentioned in the version 1 with a simple crude GUI designed using Python's Tkinter library. 
Of course the code I submitted in the password generator function in my original project was different from what it is here.
For version 1.5 I would randomise the function to more casually shuffle the different types of characters randomly to form the final password.
This version is too much generalised. 
If someone knows the pattern of arranging the letters and symbols one could easily crack the password so I am not disclosing it here.
Core idea is that the stranger the randomisation of the characters is,  the stronger is the password
Also version1.5 will have a simple python tkinter based GUI but in version two I will try to include HTML,CSS based GUI.
